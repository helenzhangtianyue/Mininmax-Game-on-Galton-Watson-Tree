# Mininmax-Game-on-Galton-Watson-Tree
In this directed study supervised by Professor Omer Angel, we discussed Martin and Stasinski's paper
about minimax functions on Galton-Watson tree, in which they examined the convergence behaviour and
discussed the question of endogeny. We also studied some other previous papers such as the paper by Ali
Khan, Devroye and Neininger in which they considered minimax function on regular trees and obtained
a distributional limit under a suitable rescaling.. This report will summarize the game setting, the main
theorems and proofs in these papers, our attempt of some further analysis and several open questions.
